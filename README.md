# CI Student Resource

![Responsive view of CL Stundent Resource from ami.responsivedesign.is](assets/images/readme/ci-student-resource-responsive.png)

The CI Student Resource website is a student-powered one-page website targeted towards Code Institute students looking for an easy overview of useful content covered in the program Diploma in Full Stack Development. The content of the website is intended to be a go to reference to use while learning the essentials of coding. 

This first iteration of the website focuses on **Shortcuts & Commands** in the IDE and Deployment Essentials module while leaving hints for future content inclusions. This is done through the disabled module navigation buttons in the mid-page Topics navigation section with a *Coming soon!* text added for clarity.  

CI Student Resource is also intended to engage other students as content providers through the **Contribute to this website** form and as collaborators in the *Get in touch* footer.

The **3 main objectives** of this website can be summarized as followed:
1. Serve useful course content in a user-friendly, structured and compact format
2. Attract fellow students and alumni as content providers of the website
3. Attract fellow students and alumni as collaborators of the website

## Testing

- CI Student Resource has been tested to work on the Chrome, Firefox, Safari and Edge browsers on desktop as well as the Safari and Chrome browsers on iOS mobile.  
- I have used Chrome DevTools to confirm that the website and layout is responsive and functions as it should on all common and standard screen sizes.
- I have tested if all external and internal links are linked correctly and behave as expected in all tested browsers and on both desktop and mobile.
- I texted the behavior of form in all browsers and on both desktop and mobile to confirm that all fields are required and only accept a valid email address in the email input field.
- I have also tested CI Student Resourse through three external Validations Tools:
  - The [W3C Markup Validation Service](https://validator.w3.org/) checked the validation of the html code and returned one error and a warning related to a duplicate ID in the code:
   - <img src="assets/images/readme/html-validation-1.png" alt="Results from the first html validations" width="400"/>
  - After removing the duplicate ID from the code and re-running validation, no issues were found:
   - <img src="assets/images/readme/html-validation-2.png" alt="Results from the second html validations" width="400"/>
  - The [W3C CSS Validation Service](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/) checked the validation of the CSS code and returned two parse errors: 
   - <img src="assets/images/readme/css-validation-1.png" alt="Results from the first css validations" width="400"/>
  - After fixing these two issues in the code and re-running no errors were returned:
   - <img src="assets/images/readme/css-validation-2.png" alt="Results from the second css validations" width="400"/>
  - [Lighthouse in DevTools](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse) an tests on the website for both desktop and mobile and scored them on a scale 1-100 in the categories Performance, Accessibility, Best Practices and SEO and returned good results for the latter three categories but scored at a 78 on Performance on mobile:
   - <img src="assets/images/readme/lighthouse-report-1.png" alt="Results from the lighthouse test on mobile" width="400"/>
    This was reported to partly be caused by the use of file in git-format of the website:
   - <img src="assets/images/readme/lighthouse-report-1-detail.png" alt="Results from the lighthouse test on mobile" width="400"/> 
   - After reformatting the video content and switching the gifs out for webm and mp4 the loading of the videos were greatly improved but did only more the performance score up to 80:

### Unresolved bugs
   - During testing of the website on desktop I found an issue with the navigation links not behaving as expected. After clicking a first navigation link and then scrolling back up to the navigation and clicking a second navigation link, the user is not taken to the intended section. The page instead flickers and lands in the wrong area. Clicking the same link again returns the expected behavior and takes the user t the correct location of the page. No solution to this bug has been found so this issue has been left unresolved. 

## Deployment
   - CI Student Resource website was deployed on GitHub pages following the steps below:
     - In the GitHub repository for the project, locate and click on Settings
     - In the left navigation bar, locate and click on Pages
     - Under Sourse, change Branch to Main and click Save
     - This will load a message above the Source, letting you know when the website has been published including a link your your website on Pages
